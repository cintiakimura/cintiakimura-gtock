# Module 1: Introduction to GTO Poker

Welcome to GTO Poker Mastery! This first module lays the foundation for your journey.

## What is GTO?

**Game Theory Optimal (GTO)** is a defensive strategy in poker where you aim to play in a way that your opponents cannot exploit you, regardless of how they play. It's about making mathematically sound, unexploitable decisions.

### Key Concepts:
- **Balance:** Mixing your plays (e.g., betting with both strong hands and bluffs) to be unpredictable.
- **Ranges:** Thinking about the entire spectrum of hands a player can have, not just one specific hand.
- **Frequencies:** Understanding how often you should take a certain action (bet, check, fold) with parts of your range.

## Why Learn GTO?

*   **Build a solid baseline:** It gives you a fundamentally strong strategy to fall back on.
*   **Understand the "why":** You'll learn the mathematical reasons behind poker decisions.
*   **Exploit others:** Once you understand GTO, you can easily spot and exploit players who deviate from it.

This course will guide you from the basics to advanced applications, using solvers and practical examples. Let's get started!
